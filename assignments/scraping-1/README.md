# Scraping assignment 1

Your task this time is pretty simple: Just take the scraper in this folder, and, using comments, explain in your own words what you think every line of the code is doing.

We've talked about this scraper at length, so you should have some general sense of what's going on. Some specific lines, though, might still be a little hard to figure out. That's ok! If you don't know what a given line of code is doing, guess.

It might be helpful at times to consult the documentation for [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [mechanize](https://mechanize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) â€” the two external libraries used in the code. [This guide](https://first-web-scraper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) might also be useful (and serve as a helpful review).

Once you're done, commit your code into either a new or existing repository and put a link to it in the spreadsheet, per usual.
